## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the School of EECS, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) as a research intern at the [State Key Laboratory of Multimedia Information Processing](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/en/), School of Computer Science, Peking University.

My current research interests primarily lie in **multimodal learning** and **embodied AI**, with a focus on **world model**. Specifically, my research interests are dedicated to exploring robust and efficient methodologies for representing world states and modeling state transitions, with the overarching goal of advancing robotic planning capabilities. I am enthusiastic about contributing to and collaborating on innovative, cutting-edge research in this field.

## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Learning:** video understanding, VLM, video generation
- **Embodied AI:** robot planning, VLA models, robot manipulation

## News

- **[Dec. 2024]** I'm honored to be the recipient of the 1st Peking University YUNDING Scholarship.
- **[Dec. 2024]** Our benchmark paper on sports video commentary for video LLMs is released!
